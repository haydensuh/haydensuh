# A Recommendation Is Not Enough

**Rethinking AI Interfaces Through the Lens of Business Purpose Suggestions**

_Incorporating a company in Korea requires a legally defined ‘business purpose’ —  
a step where many founders hesitate due to legal ambiguity and lack of precedent._

---

What makes an AI feature actually smart?

At ZUZU, we set out to improve one of the most confusing parts of starting a company: writing your business purpose. For many users, this step felt ambiguous and intimidating. There’s a required format to follow, and if the wording is off, the registration can be rejected altogether.

So we decided to build a feature where **users write a brief business overview, and the AI recommends suitable business purposes** in return.

But as we began designing this feature, we quickly learned that recommendations alone weren’t enough.

---

## AI gave us an answer. <br/>But then what?

Our first idea looked something like this:

<Image

  alt="image"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 'auto',
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02)',
    borderRadius: '8px',
  }}
/>

```
Recommended business purposes:
- Manufacturing of lunchboxes and prepared meals
- Retail sale of other processed food products
- Manufacturing of other food products
- ...
```

The user would enter keywords related to their business, and the LLM would return a list of relevant purpose statements.

We tested the output separately and found that the LLM did a good job generating accurate suggestions. But when we shared a Figma prototype internally for feedback, an unexpected issue came up: **simply showing the recommendations wasn’t enough to prompt the next action.**

Even when the suggestions looked right, people didn’t immediately choose or confirm them.  
That’s when we realized — showing the “correct” answer and guiding the user toward what to do with it are two very different things.

---

## We Didn't Just Want Output. <br/>We wanted Interaction.

This experience showed us that no matter how polished a piece of text is, it rarely leads to user action on its own. Even when an LLM generates great results in natural language, users often struggle to intuitively understand what to do next.

When AI outputs exist only as plain text, it’s still unclear **how users are supposed to interact with them.**

As AI-generated content becomes more abundant and sophisticated, the real challenge shifts to **how we help users act on that output** — and that responsibility falls squarely on the designer.

---

### So We Redesigned the Interface

Rather than simply showing results, we needed to create a structure where users could take meaningful action.  
That led us to the following UI design:

<Image
  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hazelsuh-site/image/upload/Frame_427321248_dfwsid.png"
  alt="image"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: 'auto',
    backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02)',
    borderRadius: '8px',
  }}
/>

#### [+] Button Next to Each Recommendation

- With a single click, users can move a suggested business purpose to the “selected” list.

#### Selected Items Appear in a List Below

- Chosen items are neatly organized in a list below, and users can remove them using the [-] button.

#### Manual Input Option

- If the AI doesn’t suggest what the user wants, they can manually add a new item through a text field.

#### Final Selection Used for Company Registration

- The user’s confirmed selection becomes the actual content submitted for incorporation.

#### Reorder Functionality

- Users can reorder the list based on priority or importance.

This flow wasn’t just about building a recommendation system — it was about creating a **manipulable interface** where users could accept, modify, and express their intent clearly.

---

### Static Output vs. Interactive Output

- **Purpose**: In static output, users can only view the suggested content. In contrast, interactive output allows users to select, modify, or directly input new items.

- **Result**: Static output provides a scrollable list of information, while interactive output offers a manipulable UI that enables users to actively engage with the content.

- **State Change**: With static output, user actions don’t affect the system. But with interactive output, the interface updates in real time based on user selections or input.

- **Experience**: Static output focuses on delivering information, whereas interactive output centers around the user’s goals — creating a more purposeful and guided experience.

### The Dilemma of Classification and Automation

We based our recommendations on the Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC). The suggestions themselves were fairly accurate, and the business purposes proposed by the LLM often aligned well with the company descriptions provided.

However, simply showing plausible results wasn’t enough to build trust. In some cases, the model would fabricate classification codes, and when the suggested category names were too abstract, they risked being rejected during legal review.

To help users trust and confidently select from the results, we needed to show **why** each recommendation was made. So we made a few key design decisions:

- Only show the **category name**, not the classification code, to avoid unnecessary confusion
- Provide context for each recommendation — such as how it aligns with KSIC categories and real-world examples from similar industries — to build credibility and make the logic behind the suggestions more understandable

In the end, we went beyond simply displaying information. We redesigned the structure to clearly present reasoning, helping users feel confident in what they choose.

## A Recommendation Is an Interface

A single line of AI-generated text, on its own, means very little.  
It’s the way that text is presented — and more importantly, how users can interact with it — that shapes the entire UX.

Ultimately, here’s the flow we designed for this feature:

1. The user writes a short description of their business.  
   The AI analyzes it and recommends relevant business purposes  
   (based on KSIC and internal ZUZU data).
2. The user can select from the suggestions or add their own.
3. They can reorder or delete items if needed.
4. The final selection is directly reflected in the company registration documents.

## What We Really Wanted to Build

Not just **output**, but an **actionable structure**.  
Not just **words**, but a **tool**.

> Output shouldn’t be the end — it should be the beginning.

> What the AI says matters less than what the user can do with it.

---

## Closing Thoughts

When designing AI-powered features, we often focus on **what to show**.  
But the real question should be:

> What can the user actually do with it?

ZUZU’s business purpose recommendation feature was our attempt to explore that question.  
There’s still room for improvement, but we believe we’re headed in the right direction.

AI is smart.  
Now, it’s our job to make sure that intelligence helps users take meaningful action.
