# How Do We Define Satisfaction?

**Applying Operational Definitions to ZUZU’s Business Incorporation Service**

---

**"Were you satisfied with your incorporation process?"**

It’s a question frequently asked by B2B platforms like ZUZU. For founders, incorporating a company is a meaningful first step—and that experience often shapes their level of trust in the service going forward.

But this question is more complex than it seems. <br/>
One user may feel satisfied by how fast the company was registered. Another may appreciate how accurately the system suggested business purposes based on their industry. Yet another might describe the experience as positive simply because the staff responded kindly and connected them to a reliable tax accountant.

In short, satisfaction is multi-faceted, abstract, and highly subjective.
To better understand and measure it, we need a way to make this vague concept concrete.
That’s where the idea of **operational definition** comes in.

## Turning Abstract Concepts Into Measurable Values

Satisfaction is a qualitative concept—one based on emotion, impression, and context. <br/>
This is exactly why conversations about "satisfaction" can get murky between teams, departments, or even users themselves. Everyone has a different interpretation.

**Operational definition** is a framework used to solve that problem. <br/>
It refers to the process of redefining abstract ideas in a way that makes them observable, quantifiable, and repeatable.

- Ask users to rate satisfaction on a 5-point scale and measure the average.
- Track whether users return to ZUZU after completing incorporation.
- Measure customer service inquiry rates or issue escalation frequency.
- Ask if the user would recommend ZUZU to a friend or colleague.

These are examples of **operational definitions** of satisfaction.

## How Can We Apply This to Business Incorporation?

The user journey for ZUZU’s business incorporation service typically follows three phases:

- **Entry**
  - Visiting the landing page
  - Requesting consultation
  - Signing up & entering the flow
- **Input**
  - Providing company information, shareholder details, capital, and bank certificate
- **Completion**
  - Communicating with law firms
  - Signing electronically
  - Final registration

Each step reflects a different kind of user expectation—and thus a different kind of satisfaction. <br/>
Operational definitions allow us to break this down and set measurable benchmarks for each phase.

## Defining Satisfaction by Stage

<br />
### 1. Entry — Were users successfully attracted and persuaded?

- **Qualitative idea**: "The consultation felt helpful" / "I gained trust after speaking to someone"
- **Operational definitions**:
  - Conversion rate from consultation to signup
  - Ratio of users who reach the "Start Incorporation" page
  - Users who click "Start" within 48 hours of the consultation

A high conversion rate suggests users felt confident moving forward—satisfaction, in this case, stems from reduced uncertainty.

<br />
### 2. Input — Was the process intuitive and smooth?

- **Qualitative idea**: "It was easy to navigate" / "The form wasn't confusing"
- **Operational definitions**:
  - Percentage of users who select an AI-recommended business purpose
  - Click-through rate for "Don’t have an address?" → Inquiry about virtual offices
  - Drop-off rate during shareholder or executive input
  - Average time to complete the full input process

Users who complete input without interruption likely understood the process clearly <br/>
→ UX friction points can be revealed through high drop-off at specific fields

<br />
### 3. Completion — Did everything wrap up smoothly?

- **Qualitative idea**: "I communicated clearly with the law firm" / "E-signing was straightforward"
- **Operational definitions**:
  - Ratio of users who completed e-signing after payment
  - Law firm change request rate (users who switched firms post-selection)
  - Average time from payment to incorporation completion
  - Incidents where registration was delayed due to incomplete e-signing

Satisfaction here is defined by: <br/>
No confusion, no extra work, no surprises

## What About Indirect Satisfaction?

Even without directly asking, we can infer satisfaction from user behavior:

- Revisit rate within 30 days after company registration
- Percentage of users referred by someone else ("How did you hear about us?")
- Conversion into other paid services like digital contracts or investor matching

These metrics answer questions like:

- "Was the experience good enough for them to come back?"
- "Would they trust ZUZU enough to recommend it?"
- "Did the experience make them want to stay with the platform?"

## Why Operational Definitions Matter

There are many ways to measure satisfaction, but the approach you choose shapes the insights you gain.

Relying solely on a 5-point rating scale can be risky:

- Interpretation errors: One user’s "3" may mean "average," another’s "3" may mean "surprisingly good"
- Sampling bias: Only highly satisfied or dissatisfied users might bother to respond
- Distorted signals: A high average score doesn’t always mean users are happy across the board

Operational definitions help reduce these ambiguities and provide a shared, comparable standard.

Instead of saying "Users were happy"<br/>
you can say:

> Average satisfaction was 4.3, 70% of users returned within 30 days, and 60% came via referral.

Now you have insights that drive real decisions.

## Every Good Metric Starts With a Good Question

In a multi-step journey like business incorporation, you need to define what you want to learn—before defining how you’ll measure it.

Here are some guiding questions:

- Which part of the process makes users most anxious?
- Where are users most likely to drop off?
- If users delay payment, is it due to a lack of trust or a pricing concern?

Once those questions are clear, you can build operational definitions that translate them into measurable data.

## Final Thoughts

Operational definitions aren’t just about quantifying user sentiment.
They’re about clarifying what we truly want to understand—and capturing that understanding through real, observable behavior.

If you want to measure satisfaction, you first need to ask:
When does satisfaction occur? In what context? What does it look like in action?

That’s how operational definitions begin.
And that’s how ZUZU can evolve from a helpful service into a platform users truly trust.
